### Minesweeper

This is my try at minsweeper in assembly. After I learned enough about assembly's general syntax I was really excited to give minesweeper a go, especially since I could use colors and user input (arrow keys) in a way I wasn't really able to before in C++.

This implementation of minesweeper is somewhat incomplete and not documented as well as my other programs, however it is a good example of a multi-file assembly program.

It also has a good flood-fill algorithm and what I would consider a good usage of clamping.

`Minesweeper_1.asm` was my initial testing file.
