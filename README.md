### Assembly Source

Most of my assembly programs are single files, so this is git repo that consolidates some of my assembly code. The only multi-file project is Minesweeper, which has its own readme.

So far, I have only programmed in Microsoft Macro Assembler with the Irvine library. Compile instructions for MASM are [here](http://www.asmirvine.com)
